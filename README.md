# Galois-Theory-Leinster
These are my solutions the exercises in Tom Leinster's lecture notes on Galois Theory. The notes can be found here: https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~tl/gt/gt.pdf

I have also uploaded these to:
https://math.solverer.com/library/tom_leinster/galois_theory

which is an excellent website that has a plethora of solutions to some incredible texts.

A work in progress...
